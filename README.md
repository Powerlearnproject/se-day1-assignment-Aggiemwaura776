# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
-Its systematically applying engineering principles,methods and tools to develop and maintain high quality software systems.
-It powers various aspects in modern day life including communication,commerce entertainment etc

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
-Development of programming languages-eg Fortran,C
-Its establishment as a discipline in the 1990s
-The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-Requirement - Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements
-Design- Creating high level and detailed designs of software architecture and user interface
-Implementation -Writing code and building the software according to design and specifications.
-Testing -to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
-Deployment-Releasing the software to users or customers
-Maintainance- Providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.


Waterfall:

- Approach: Linear and sequential.
- Characteristics: Predictable, thorough documentation, inflexible to changes.
- Best For: Projects with fixed requirements.
- **Example Scenario:** Developing a government regulatory compliance system with strict requirements.

Agile:

- Approach: Iterative and incremental.
- Characteristics: Flexible, collaborative, with frequent feedback.
- Best For: Projects with evolving requirements.
- Example Scenario: Creating a mobile app for a startup where user feedback drives ongoing improvements.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.

-Software developer-Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions,
-Quality Assurance Engineer-Ensures quality by designing and executing test plans.
-Project manager-Oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
-IDEs;-Provides comprehensive tools for writing debugging and testing code e.g Visual studio
-VCS;-Tracks changes to source code and coordinating work among team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Challenges--If there are Changing requirements made.
           -Tight deadlines.
           -Technical debt
Strategies-Effective communication
          -prioritization of tasks
          -Regular reassessment of projrct goals and timeline


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-Unit testing-Test individual components module of software
-Intergration-Tests interactions between different components or subsystems.
-System-Tests the entire system
-Acceptance-Tests the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs.

Importance:-It ensures quality control and helps to identify and fix defects early in development process.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
-Its crafting your questions/instructions in a way that helps get the best responses from you AI assistant.
-Interacting with AI models is crucial because it enables efficient problem-solving, enhances decision-making, and improves productivity by automating tasks. It also provides valuable insights through data analysis, helping users make informed choices and streamline workflows.



Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
